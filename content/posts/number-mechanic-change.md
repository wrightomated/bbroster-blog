"I'm number 23 coach" mumbled the rookie lineman as he was tightening his boots.
"Sorry matey, need to be wearing sixteen or below to get a game in this team" said the coach tapping his pen on the roster in his hands.

100% a conversation that happened. Ridiculous if you think about it in modern day standards, because as of today any player that wears number 1 - 99 will have a place in your roster. Also you may order the numbers anyway you see fit.

This was a common suggestion so hopefully it give a bit more freedom in how you form your team.

If your numbers are 100 and above, sorry buddy, out of luck.
