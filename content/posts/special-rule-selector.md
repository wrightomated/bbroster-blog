Fret no longer you can now officially\* collect Blood for the Blood God!

![Select special rule](/images/new-khorne-team.png)

One feature that has been lacking for a while is to be able to show your true devotion to your chosen god of Chaos!

This wasn't too much of an issue roster wise before those northerners showed up. Now Norse have adorned their new rules it means their star players can be drastically different between **Old World Classic** and **Chosen of...**.

If your current team is not affiliated to any chaotic persuasion you'll now be prompted to rectify the situation.

This will be able to be changed at any time when the _Roster Summary_ is available.

\*BBRoster is still unofficial
