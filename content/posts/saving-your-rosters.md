## Preserving your Rosters

With the upcoming transition to Blood Bowl 2025, I want to clarify what will happen to your existing rosters and how to ensure you don't lose your teams' journeys.

If you haven't already read about the Blood Bowl 2025 transition plan, please check out the [BB Roster 2025: Transition Plan](https://blog.bbroster.com/posts/blood-bowl-2025-transition/) post first. It outlines how the site will be changing and what to expect.

## Registered Users

If you're already registered, you're all set! Your 2020 rosters are saved to your account and will be accessible on **2020.bbroster.com** (the current ruleset) when the transition happens. You'll use the same account for both sites, making it easy to switch between versions.

## Not Registered Yet?

If you haven't registered yet, now is a great time to do so! Registering will save all your current rosters and ensure they're automatically available on the legacy site when the transition happens.

## Prefer Not to Register?

That's perfectly fine! I understand that not everyone wants to create an account. There's a new **Export to CSV** button that allows you to save all your roster codes locally. It can be found on the `Load Team` screen.

When **2020.bbroster.com** goes live, you'll be able to manually load these roster codes into the site. While this requires a bit more manual work compared to having an account, it ensures you maintain complete control over your data without needing to register.

## How to Export Your Rosters

1. Look for the new **Export to CSV** button on the site
2. Click it to download a file containing all your roster codes
3. Keep this file safe until 2020.bbroster.com launches
4. When ready, you can manually import these codes into the legacy site
