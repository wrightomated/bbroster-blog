The Restless Try Hards were in shambles last match as their journeyman was a skeleton instead of a zombie. The coach swore if they had the additional AV the journeyman would have endured the block and probably won them the game.

If you want a zombie you have a zombie! Now all journeymen types are available for teams that have multiple linemen. Including those ragtag dungeon dwelling folk.
