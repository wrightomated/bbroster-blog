## Getting Ready for Blood Bowl 2025

With Blood Bowl 2025 approaching, I wanted to share the transition plan for BB Roster. While I'm eager to implement the new rules and changes, I'll need to wait for my boxset pre-order to arrive before I can finalize all the updates.

## Current State: Beta Testing

In the meantime, **beta.bbroster.com** is now live and will serve as the testing ground for the Blood Bowl 2025 version. This is where I'll be implementing and refining the new rules, teams, and features. Along with the 2025 updates, there are also some behind-the-scenes improvements being made.

If you're adventurous and want to try out the new version as it develops, feel free to visit the beta site. Just keep in mind it's a work in progress, and things may change as I continue to refine the implementation.

**Login is not enabled on the beta site yet. Teams created there will not carry over to the main site and might be deleted without notice.**

## Future: The Transition

Once I'm satisfied with the stability and accuracy of the Blood Bowl 2025 implementation, here's how the transition will work:

- **beta.bbroster.com** → **bbroster.com** (Blood Bowl 2025 becomes the main site)
- **bbroster.com** → **2020.bbroster.com** (2020 Blood Bowl ruleset preserved)

The 2020.bbroster.com site will continue to function exactly as bbroster.com does today, preserving access to the current Blood Bowl ruleset for those who need it. This ensures that everyone can continue using their preferred version of the game without disruption.

## Stay Tuned

I'll keep you updated as development progresses. Thank you for your patience and continued support as we make this transition together!
