## Will BBRoster support Blood Bowl 2025?

Yes! It might not be on day one, but before the year is out. I don't think it will be a huge change. All existing rosters will remain and I'll hopefully have an elegant way to deal with the new version.

## Existing Updates

Updates have been pretty slow recently. Most my free time is poured into my family and the non-digital hobby. There are so many things I want to do with BBRoster! The pesky conundrum of time stikes constantly.

I might be able to get some of the changes I have in progress after the rule changes are out as well. So let me know if there are any interest in the following.

Current WIP includes:

- Tournament Support
  - Basic settings (budget, team size, format, etc)
  - Custom stars, inducements, and team rosters
  - Skill packs
- Editing Match History
- Setups

- User Interface Improvements
